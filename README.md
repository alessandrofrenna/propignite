# Propignite

### A [Propel 2](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2) library that works with [Codeigniter](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter)

Use **Propel 2** active record with **Codeigniter**.
Replace the default Codeigniter active record with the powerful one given by **Propel 2**.

## Easy to install

*Clone* or *download* the repository from this page or run:

```sh
git clone -u master https://github.com/alessandrofrenna/propignite.git <output_directory>
```
> Run the command in a command line interface such bash, cmd..

Now that you cloned the library, copy the cloned files to your project folder and, add to your `composer.json`:

```composer
"require" : {
    //other libraries...
    "propel/propel" : "~2.0@dev"
}, 
...
"autoload" : {
    "psr-4": {
        "Codeigniter\\Propel": "application/libraries/Propel"
    }
} 
```

```sh
composer update
```

> If you don't have a `composer.json` file, feel free to copy in your project folder out `composer.json` file and then run:
```sh
composer install
```

# Make it works:

- Open your autoload configuration file in your `application/config` folder.
- Search for `$autoload['libraries']` and add `'Propel/Propel' => 'propel'` to the array.
    ```php
        $autoload['libraries'] = ('...others', 'Propel/Propel' => 'propel');
    ```
- Save the configuration file and exit.

# What about configuration ? 
You can edit `application/config/propel.php` file to meet your requirements.

The `propel.php` file, contains the basic configuration parameters that must be used to make 
**Propel 2** works properly.

The file include configurations for: 

- Database:
    1. Connections.
        Connections are defined in the following way

        ```php
        $active_record['propel']['database']['connections']['<database name>'] = [
            //PARAMS...
        ]
        ```
- Paths: here we define the default path used to store almost all of the **Propel 2** generated files.
> It is risky to edit this part of the configuration file. If you don't want to have troubles don't touch this part of the config file.

- Runtime:
    1. Each time you need, use `defaultConnection` to set the default database connection to use.
    2. Add in the `connections` array, all the connections defined in the ***Database > Connection*** configuration.

- Generator:
    1. Each time you need, use `defaultConnection` to set the default database connection to use with the generator.
    2. Add in the `connections` array, all the connections defined in the ***Database > Connection*** configuration.

- Reverse
> Don't touch this configuration part to avoid trouble at runtime

- Migrations
> Don't touch this configuration part to avoid trouble at runtime


### Obviously, these are the basic configurations provided by this library. 
### You can add other parameters by following the documentation: [Configuration Reference](http://propelorm.org/documentation/reference/configuration-file.html).

# Ready, Set... Go!

It's time to make everything work.
**Propel 2** comes with an integrated *CLI* that can be found inside `vendor/bin/propel`. Use the command `vendor/bin/propel list` to see the list of all the commands.

Each file that is generated by the *CLI* is stored inside your project's `root` folder inside the `propel` directory.

## IMPORTANT: each command you run, must be followed by --config-dir application/config to avoid errors.

### Generate a usable configuration file for the library:
```sh
vendor/bin/propel config:convert --config-dir application/config
```
>This command is IMPORTANT because it helps us to generate the correct configuration file for the library. Run the command each time you update your `application/config/propel.php` file.
